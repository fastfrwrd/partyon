It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development.  It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.\n\n\n# Installation\n\nTo install the latest stable release with the command-line tool:\n```sh\nsudo npm -g install sails\n```\n\n\n# Creating a New Sails Project\n\nCreate a new app\n```sh\n# Create the app\nsails new testProject\n```\n\nLift Sails\n```sh\n# cd into the new folder\ncd testProject\n\n# Fire up the server  \nsails lift\n```\n\nThe default port for Sails is 1337.  At this point if you visit <a href=\"http://localhost:1337/\">http://localhost:1337/</a> You will see the default index.html page.  \n\n<!--\nNow, let's get Sails to tell us Hello.\n\n\n# Hello, Sails!\n\nTo get Sails to say \"Hello World!\", you need only to define one controller with an action and define\none route. Lets start with the controller.\n\n```sh\nsails generate controller hello index\n```\n\nThis will generate a file called `HelloController.js` in your app's `api/controllers` directory with one action, `index()`.\n\nNow let's edit that action to send back the string `'Hello World!'`.\n\n```javascript\n\nvar HelloController = {\n\n\tindex: function(req, res) {\n\t\tres.send('Hello World!');\n\t}\n}\n\nmodule.exports = HelloController;\n```\n\nAfter you have added that, you will want to remove the default index.html page that shows at the\nstart of your application.\n\n```sh\nrm ui/public/index.html\n```\n\nWe want the application to display this hello response when a request for the root \"/\" route\ncomes in. Go into the **/config/routes.js** file. Here you can manually define these mappings,\nand here we will do so. Change the file to look like this.\n\n```javascript\nvar routes = {\n\t'/': {\n\t\tcontroller: 'hello',\n\t\taction: 'index'\n\t}\n}\n\nmodule.exports = routes;\n```\n\nAs you will see when working more with Sails, one great feature is that by default, you do not have\nto define incoming routes to controller actions. This is talked more about in the \n<a href=\"https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/wiki/Routing\">Routing page</a> of this wiki.\n\nFinally, restart the server by going to your node terminal and pressing control+c. Then enter the\nfollowing.\n\n```sh\nsails lift\n```\n\nNow when you visit <a href=\"http://localhost:1337/\">http://localhost:1337/</a> your browser should say **'Hello World!'**.\n\n-->\n\n# Creating a Model\nCreating a model is very easy with the command line tool. You can even define attributes and their\ntype by adding arguments at the end of the command. To generate a User model, enter the following:\n```\nsails generate model User\n```\nIf you check out your app, you'll notice that this created a file at **/api/model/User.js**.\n\n<!--\n  Let's give her a name-- try uncommenting the name attribute so it looks more or less like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar User = {\n        attributes      : {\n                name: 'STRING'\n        }\n\n};\nmodule.exports = User;\n```\n-->\n\n# What's Better Than Scaffolding?  How About a free JSON API?\n\nSails API scaffolding is nothing like Rails scaffolding. HTML scaffolds just don't make sense for \nmodern web apps! Instead, Sails automatically builds a RESTful JSON API for your models. Best of\nall, it supports HTTP _and_ WebSockets! By default for every controller you create, you get the\nbasic CRUD operations created automatically.\n\nFor instance, after generating the User model above, if you visit `http://localhost:1337/user/create`, you'll see:\n```json\n{\n  \"createdAt\": \"2013-01-10T01:33:19.105Z\",\n  \"updatedAt\": \"2013-01-10T01:33:19.105Z\",\n  \"id\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThat's it!  You just created a model in the database!  You can also `find`, `update`, and `destroy` users:\n\n```\n# List of all users\nhttp://localhost:1337/user\n\n# Find the user with id 1\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/1\n\n# Create a new user\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/create?name=Fisslewick\n(or send an HTTP POST to http://localhost:1337/user)\n\n# Update the name of the user with id 1\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/update/1?name=Gordo\n(or send an HTTP PUT to http://localhost:1337/user/1)\n\n# Destroy the user with id 1\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/destroy/1\n(or send an HTTP DELETE to http://localhost:1337/user/1)\n```\n\n\n## Additional Features\nSails does a few things other Node.js MVC frameworks can't do:\n- Automatically generated JSON API for manipulating models means you don't have to write any backend code to build simple database apps\n- Built-in authentication, role-based access control, and customizable policies assignable at the controller/action level\n- Transport agnostic routing: Sails controllers also handle Socket.io / WebSocket messages!  This makes it much easier to send the server-originated or 'comet' notifications you need for features like chat, realtime analytics, and multiplayer games.\n- Automatic asset minification with Rigging: Your UI code is automatically included in development mode, and minified into a simple, gzipped file in production.\n  - Support for:\n    - CoffeeScript\n    - LESS\n    - SASS / SCSS\n\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation here: \nhttps://github.com/balderdashy/sails/wiki/_pages\n\n\n\nDependencies and Compatibility\n--\n\nTested with node 0.8.1\nSails is built on the rock-solid foundations of ExpressJS and Socket.io.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--\n![icon_circlechart@2x.png](http://i.imgur.com/hXc06.png) \n\nDemo\n--\n\n*Try it in two browser windows*\n\nhttp://sailsjs.com:1337/experiment#subcomponents\n\n\n#### Code\nhttps://github.com/balderdashy/sails-example\n-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![icon_circleheart@2x.png](http://i.imgur.com/liHPV.png) \n## Who Built This?\n\nThe Sails framework was developed by Mike McNeil (@mikermcneil) and is maintained by Balderdash (@balderdashy), a realtime web & mobile studio I started with Heather White (@hdesignsit) in Austin, TX.\n\nAfter building a few realtime javascript apps and taking them into production, we realized that the  JavaScript development landscape is very much still the Wild West.  Over time, after trying lots of different methodologies (on the front end and the back), we decided to crystallize all of our best practices into this framework.  I hope it saves you some time :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![icon_circlelightbulb@2x.png](http://i.imgur.com/eOFXn.png)  \n\nLicense\n--\n\nSails is built around so many great open-source technologies that it would never have crossed our minds to keep it proprietary.  We owe huge gratitude and props to TJ Holowaychuk (@visionmedia) and Guillermo Rauch (@guille) for the work they did, as well as the stewards of all the other open-source modules we use.  Sails could never have been developed without your tremendous contributions to the node community.\n\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n--\n\nCopyright © 2012-2013 Mike McNeil\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
