It uses great open-source plugins that already exist to allow for:\n\n- CSS minification\n- Javascript minification\n- Retina display downsizing and thumbnail generation (coming soon, see https://github.com/balderdashy/deretina)\n- Automatic spritesheet compilation (coming soon)\n- Conditional serving of images based on screen size (coming soon)\n\nInstallation\n--\n```npm install rigging```\n\n\nCompatibility\n--\nTested with node 0.6.4 up to node 0.8.1\n\n\n## Who Built This?\nThe Sails framework, including Mast, Rigging, and other related packages, are jointly developed and supported by Mike McNeil and Balderdash Design Co.  Balderdashs build wonderful web apps as a service, and after much frustration, we built Sails to use on our customers' projects.  Naturally, we open-sourced it.  Hopefully, it makes your life a little bit easier!\n\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n--\n\nCopyright © 2012 Mike McNeil\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
